# CSC-103-aGameAboutU
This program was made as the final project for CSC 103: Creative Computing.
I may have gone a little overboard on the scope of the project, but it ended up turning out really well!
A Game About U is a simple platformer with a gentle ascii artstyle and quiet ambience.
You'll explore various areas around your home city in your quest to find you best friend and/or lover, V.
Use W, A, and D to navigate the screen and try to progress through the game.
While the game is pretty short and not too brilliant, I put a lot of time and effort into my first big coding project!
Please enjoy!
